I am currently a graduate student at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu), working under the mentorship of [Dr. Chris Brown](https://chbrown13.github.io/) within the [Code World No Blanket Group](https://code-world-no-blanket.github.io/). My research focuses on building AI-driven tools for software development, enriched by insights from human psychology to enhance user experience and efficiency. Specifically, I am developing solutions that make large-scale program comprehension and onboarding processes more accessible and engaging for developers.

My research targets the critical needs of developers in understanding complex codebases, making the onboarding of new team members smoother, and supporting collaborative software development environments. With the goal of creating tools that streamline workflows, I strive to bridge the gap between cognitive challenges and the practicalities of software engineering.

Before entering graduate school, I spent several years as a software developer and tech lead, where I honed my technical skills and led cross-functional projects. This hands-on industry experience has been invaluable in my research, enabling me to ground my work in real-world challenges that software developers face daily. By integrating my development background with my current academic pursuits, I aim to deliver intuitive AI solutions that genuinely address the needs of the tech community and contribute to the evolution of software engineering practices.
