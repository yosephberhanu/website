I am a graduate student at virginia tech under the supervision of [Dr. Chris Brown](https://chbrown13.github.io/) at the [Code World No Blanket Group](https://code-world-no-blanket.github.io/). I'm passionate about building AI tools that assist users by considering their psychological state. Currently, I am focused on developing tools specifically for software development and developers. My current research explores methods to automatically detect cognitive biases in decision-making throughout the development life cycle. Prior to graduate school, I worked as a software developer and tech lead, and Iâ€™m excited to apply that hands-on experience to my current research. By leveraging my background in software development, I aim to create more intuitive and effective AI solutions for the tech community.
