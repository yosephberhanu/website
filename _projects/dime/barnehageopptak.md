## Project Description

We developed a [cloud-based software platform](https://barnehageopptak.no) designed to automate and streamline administrative processes in public services, including kindergarten admissions in Norway. The key features and benefits of their kindergarten software included:
1.	__Pre-Filled Application Forms__: The platform simplified the application process for parents by providing pre-filled forms, reducing the time and effort required to submit accurate information.
2.	__Integration with Municipal Systems__: The software integrated seamlessly with existing municipal systems, allowing for efficient handling of applications and reducing manual work for administrators.
3.	__Automated Processing__: It automated key steps in the admissions process, such as verifying eligibility, checking deadlines, and assigning available spots, which improved the overall efficiency.
4.	__User-Friendly Design__: The platform was designed to be accessible for both parents and municipal staff, providing a straightforward user interface and clear instructions.
5.	__Improved Transparency__: By digitizing the admissions process, the software increased transparency for applicants, providing real-time updates on the status of their applications.
6.	__Partnerships and Customization__: The software was developed in collaboration with municipalities and other public sector partners, ensuring it met the specific needs of local administrations and regulations.

While the software was innovative and aimed at improving efficiency in public administration, Digital Medarbeider as a company is no longer operational, and the software is no longer actively supported. However, its impact contributed to the digital transformation of public services in Norway.
