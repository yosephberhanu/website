## Project Description
iWORLAIS (interim WOReda Land Administration Information System) is a software built as an interim system to be used for handling of land transitions until the national system [(NRLAIS)](https://www.hansaluftbild.de/fileadmin/Dateien/PDF/Veroeffentlichungen/WorldBankConference2019_LandAdministrationEthiopia.pdf) was ready to be rolled out to the _Woredas_ (administrative unites in Ethiopia). It supported all transactions as prescribed in the Land Admin Manual to the same level as the national system would. The design and development of subsequent national system was greatly influenced by iWORLAIS. While primary source of date of iWORLAIS is MASSREG through mass migration of data, it supported sporadic registration of land parcels which introduced new parcels into the system. It was developed for the Ethiopian [Land Investment for Transformation (LIFT) Program](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/ethiopia-land-investment-transformation-lift) by [DAI](https://www.dai.com).

## Current Status
iWORLAIS has been successfully implemented and deployed in all _Woredas_ that . It is now replaced by the national system once it was ready. The data maintained by iWORLAIS was transferred to WORLAIS component of NRLAIS. 
## Demo
Yohannes Reda, the project manger for NRLAIS, does an excellent job at demostrating some features of WORLAIS component of NRLAIS in the following video.
