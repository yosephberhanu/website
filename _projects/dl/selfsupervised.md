This project focused on implementing a self-supervised learning method using PyTorch. The network is trained on the CIFAR10 dataset to classify how each image has been rotated and is then fine-tuned on a supervised task. I also implemented Grad-CAM for ResNet18 from scratch and provided  visualizations and compared with initial gradient-based attention method.

#### Key Features:
- Implemented self-supervised learning method.
- Trained network on CIFAR10 dataset with and without pre-training.
- Reported results on various network variations.

#### Tools and Technologies:
- Python
- PyTorch

### Source Code
The complete source code for this project is available on [GitHub](#).
