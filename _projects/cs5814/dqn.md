I implemented Deep Q-Learning and Double Q-Learning algorithms to play an Atari game called Breakout using the OpenAI Gym. This task provided hands-on experience in reinforcement learning and sequence models.The input to these algorithms was the raw pixel value and the models learned to play the game. 


#### Key Features:
- Implemented Deep Q-Learning and Double Q-Learning algorithms.
- Trained the models on an Atari game from the OpenAI Gym.
- Achieved a mean score of 10 for regular Q and 15 for double Q.
- Ran both algorithms for the same number of iterations for fair comparison.

#### Tools and Technologies:
- Python
- PyTorch
- Anaconda Python (for local work)
- Google Colab / glogin cluster (for GPU access)
