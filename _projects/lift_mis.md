## Project Description

The LIFT MIS is the central repository of both static and dynamic data to inform, or to be used by management in making strategic and operational decisions based on real data. It is developed for [Land Investment for Transformation (LIFT) Program](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/ethiopia-land-investment-transformation-lift) by [DAI](https://www.dai.com). The MIS is a multi-layered web application and will continue to grow throughout the lifetime of the project. There are two major parts of the MIS: The static/pdf document repository and the dynamic spreadsheet processor and report generator â€“ which is a custom-built application.

## Current Status

LIFT MIS has been successfully implemented and deployed until the completion of the project. It was adopted for use by the National Rural Land Information System [(NRLAIS)](https://www.hansaluftbild.de/fileadmin/Dateien/PDF/Veroeffentlichungen/WorldBankConference2019_LandAdministrationEthiopia.pdf). NRLAIS is operated and maintained by [Ministry of Agriculture](http://moa.gov.et/).
